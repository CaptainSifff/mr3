# mr3
An implementation of the MR^3 algorithm for the symmetric eigenvalue problem.
Based on the PhD thesis by Inderjit Singh Dhillon:
A New O(n^2) Algorithm for the Symmetric Tridiagonal Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Problem
and the PhD thesis by Paul Willems:
On MR^3-type Algorithms for the Tridiagonal Symmetric Eigenproblem and the Bidiagonal SVD.
